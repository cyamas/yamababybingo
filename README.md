# yamababybingo

Welcome to the Baby Bingo Game project! This project simulates a simple Bingo game using Python (Flask) for the backend, vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, and Redis for managing game state. However, instead of drawing numbers, it draws images of baby registry items, giving players the opportunity to view and buy items as they are drawn.
